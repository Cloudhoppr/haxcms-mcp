"""Content and generic block tools: the twelve Phase 4 content tools (PLAN T4.5).

Reads (`get_page_content`, `get_page_blocks`) and the whole-body write
(`set_page_content`, destructive) go through `services/content/service`; the block
operations go through `services/content/blocks` (one GET + one PATCH content per call,
one git revision per save). `add_block` validates tag and attributes against the Block
Catalog first; `list_blocks` / `get_block_schema` expose that catalog (bundled entries,
merged with live server schemas when a site is addressed).

Anchor grammar (PLAN §2.3, shared by every anchored operation):
`anchor` addresses ONE top-level block — either a case-insensitive text substring
(matched against block text and, for media blocks, attribute values like alt/source) or
a tag selector (`p`, `media-image`, `media-image[alt*=prairie]`, `tag[attr=value]`).
A lowercase single word that looks like a selector is treated as one. `occurrence`
disambiguates multiple matches: `"first"` (default), `"last"`, or a 1-based number.
Unresolvable anchors fail with ANCHOR_NOT_FOUND (with block previews) or
ANCHOR_AMBIGUOUS (listing every match) — nothing is saved in that case.
